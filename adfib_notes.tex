\section{Introduction}

\begin{comment}
{\chris Christina's questions to Steve:}

I had a question regarding choice of (co)limits in
categories. Please excuse my naivety, I haven't
really gone into depths of such questions before
because I guess if one can avoid them, they tend
to! But any insight or 'big picture' idea from you
would be really, really appreciated to help me
understand better a situation I find myself in. In
particular, feel free to correct me in the
following statements.

(1) 'Choosing limits' in a complete category
amounts to choosing a specific (of the many
isomorphic ones) adjoint to the constant diagram
functor. Therefore if a category has limits, we
can assume it has chosen ones. Does this already
require the axiom of choice?

(2) Therefore this choice is already
'functorial'. However, can we 'choose the choice'?
In particular, is it reasonable to say that if C
has pushouts for example, there is such a specific
choice such that the pushout of f along the
identity 'is' exactly f (and the identity)?

(3) If a functor $F:C\to D$ between categories
with pushouts preserves them in the ordinary
sense, can we actually make a choice of them in C
and in D, such that F strictly preserves them?
What assumptions should I make to be able to do
that?  Or this is somehow extra, i.e. needs to be
checked or required?

Thanks so much in advance for any intuition that
would help wrap my head around these!

A quick question to end: it is a fact that every
Grothendieck fibration is a particular case of
Street fibration, and I also read that every
Street fibration factors as an equivalence of
categories followed by a Grothendieck one.  (I am
in the process of reading Street's paper, but)
does this by any chance induce an equivalence of
categories? Fib with StreetFib?

{\chris Steve's response:}

1. As you say, choosing limits amounts to choosing
a specific adjoint to the diagonal functor (with
corresponding statements holding if you are using
weighted limits). I certainly allow myself to
regard a category with limits as having chosen
ones if I wish. I suppose from a formal point of
view that does require the axiom of choice, but I
also use this as necessary.  The category of sets
does have a canonical choice, which means that
many of the most commonly occurring complete
categories also have a canonical choice.

2. Functoriality is automatic, irrespective of
choice issues. There is also no problem with first
using the canonical choice where it exists (for
example with pushouts along identities) and then
extending this arbitrarily to deal with other
cases.  I guess that once again you need the axiom
of choice for this, but are you actually worried
about that?

3. I have never thought about this - at first
sight it seems a bit unnatural. In any case, I
think that this is not automatic. Let $2={0->1}$
be the arrrow category, and let
$C=2\times 2\times 2$ be the free-living
commutative cube.  Each face of the cube is in
fact a pushout; in fact C has a unique choice of
pushouts. Let D be the category obtained from the
square $2\times 2$ by adding an extra object c
isomorphic to (1,1). Then D contains two
commutative squares: the original 2x2, and one
using the new object. This category once again has
pushouts, but now there are choices to make.
There is an evident (unique) functor f:C->D
sending the top face of the cube to the first
square and the bottom face the second
square. Whatever choice of pushouts you make in D,
either the pushout in the top face of C or that in
the bottom face will fail to be preserved
strictly.

Regarding your question about fibrations, there is
a question as to what your ``categories of
fibrations'' are.  But perhaps more natural would
be to consider 2-categories, and then look for a
biequivalence between these. This can be done.

{\chris More of Steve's correspondence:}

How should I formally treat the statement `F:C->D
strictly preserves (co)limits' in practice? How
can I check whether a certain functor satisfies
that?

I'll just talk about limits, but analogous things
hold for colimits; also for limits or colimits of
some given class.

Well the first thing I would say is that it only
makes sense if C and D have chosen limits.  And
pretty much the only way that you can hope for F
to preserve them is if the chosen limits and C and
D have both been constructed via chosen limits
from some other given categories (which might
include C or D or might be something else).

For example, if K has chosen limits, then we might
choose limits in functor categories [A,K] and
[B,K] to be the pointwise ones, and then
restriction along any B->A will give a functor
[A,K]->[B,K] which strictly preserves these. This
includes the case of the source and target
functors Gph -> Set.

Or if K and L have chosen limits, and f:K->L is an
arbitrary functor, then we can equip the comma
category f/L with chosen limits in such a way that
the projections f/L->L and f/L->K strictly
preserve limits; and furthermore, a functor into
f/L will strictly preserve limits if and only if
its composite with each of the projections does
so.

These sort of things are the only real cases I
know where I specific functor will strictly
preserve limits.

On the other hand if K and L have chosen limits
and those in K are free, in a suitable sense, then
any continuous K->L is isomorphic to one which
strictly preserves limits.

There are various subtle things about strict
preservation. For example, we know that a category
has all finite limits iff it has finite products
and equalizers, and similarly for preservation;
but if you move to strict preservation, then you
need to be careful about the specific way that you
are making the choices.

\begin{comment}
{\chris John's questions and ideas:}

"a right adjoint [left inverse] is an opfibration
if both categories have pushouts and the functor
(strictly) preserves them. But it's not an iff!"
Nice result - except for the "strictly preserves
pushouts".  I don't mind that it's not an iff.

One almost never considers categories with chosen
pushouts, and you need chosen pushouts to talk
about strict preservation of pushouts.  Let me
see; maybe it's not so evil if we do things right.

If we take the usual forgetful functor Graph ->
Set, its left adjoint lets us see Set as a full
subcategory of Gph - is that always true when we
have a right adjoint left inverse functor?  We can
pick chosen pushouts for all pushout diagrams in
Graph (if we have a lot of time on our hands ) and
for diagrams which happen to live in the
subcategory Set these give chosen pushouts in Set.
Does it work that way whenever both categories
have pushouts and our functor is a right adjoint
left inverse?

Next, does making this choice of pushouts (which
is the best possible way I can imagine to choose
pushout for both Graph and Set in a compatible
way) make the forgetful functor Gph -> Set
preserve those pushouts strictly???  (I'm using
Gph and Graph interchangeably here, sorry.)

Summary: if in examples we can figure out an easy
procedure to choose pushouts to make our right
adjoint left inverse strictly preserve those
chosen pushouts, it's not too terrible to assume
strict preservation for a theorem.  However, it's
still evil in the technical sense.

And if we can figure out general conditions under
which we can get this strict preservation we
should state them, because otherwise this result
looks bizarre and useless.

Indeed, I'd be happier to state a theorem that
didn't mention strict preservation of pushouts,
and use some clever trick to get strict
preservation of pushouts as part of the proof.

That black-boxes the evil.

I am sorry, I am really not as good as everyone
else in understanding and writing math in a chat
:smiley:

As far as I understand this, choosing limits or
colimits is really not that bad to begin with (or
that's what I thought after some emails with Steve
Lack), it's really just saying "the" adjoint to
the constant diagram functor as opposes to "an"
adjoint to the constant diagram functor. So it is
natural to for example choose pushouts in Set in a
way such that the pushout of a function along the
identity IS the same function.(edited) Now strict
preservation is used to induce a Grothendieck
opfibration structure rather than a Street
opfibration structure. (the plan is to have both
versions of the theorem in the paper). So given
that, working so much with fibrations, I feel very
comfortable around that particular evilness
:smiley: , I don't mind that strict clause there.

Finally, and I still want/need to understand this
better, it seems like for functors that are
fibrations/opfibrations, preserving some limit
ends up being equivalent to strictly preserving
it!!!!! For some choice. Of course that's not true
for arbitrary functors.

I am sorry if I am out of topic John, I hope I'm not

John Baez12/06/2018 Hi Christina!  I was hoping
you'd tell me how to choose pushouts in Set and
Gph in such a way that the right adjoint Gph ->
Set strictly preserves the chosen pushouts.  Maybe
this is too easy and obvious for you; if so, maybe
you can tell me a general theorem that says when a
functor that preserves pushouts (in the usual
up-to-canonical-isomorphism sense) can be
"improved" to a naturally isomorphic functor that
strictly preserves pushouts.

Of course I'll let you choose the pushouts in any
you want as well as replacing the functor by a
naturally isomorphic functor.

If I had a general theorem like this, I'd agree
that "strictly preserving pushouts" is not so bad
- I could just use this theorem.  I have similar
questions about the "right adjoint left inverse"
idea.

For one functor to strictly be the left inverse of
another is an evil concept, i.e. not invariant
under natural isomorphism.  But maybe you know a
theorem that says "if you have a functor that's
left inverse of another functor up to natural
isomorphism, under some conditions we can replace
it with one that's left inverse on the nose,
i.e. strictly."

And then, of course, if I'm trying to get a right
adjoint left inverse to also strictly preserve
pushouts, I need these two theorems I'm hoping for
to not conflict with each other!

That is, it would be bad if making the functor be
a strict left inverse required changing it in a
way that would destroy its strict preservation of
chosen pushouts.

Maybe we should first change the functor so that
it's a left inverse, and then choose pushouts so
they're strictly preserved.

Christina12/06/2018

No definitely choosing the pushouts in a way that
they are strictly preserved is not easy or obvious
to me. That has been a worry of mine within the
connecting ladder between decorated cospans and
structured cospans since before last summer. So I
definitely think the things you mentioned above
should be clarified, and it would be great if they
did.

1) Hermida seemed to imply that whenever an opfibration preserves colimits, there is a way to replace the functor by a naturally isomorphic one that strictly preserves them. I want to better understand this.

2) For Graph and Set I'm more relaxed in specific, but for the coproducts not for the pushouts, because the monoidal Grothendieck construction gives a strict preservation of + and 0 right away, so our decorated->structured theorem will certainly work.

3) For the left inverse VS (co)reflection (where the (co)unit is an isomorphism rather than the identity) I'm even less sure about. At least Grph->Set indeed satisfies the strict case already.

4) And then the mixing of those two things up would of course be divine. :smiley:

John Baez12/06/2018
Okay, so this is some stuff that would be nice to understand.

Todd Trimble and I came up with a general guess about when a functor between categories induces a fibration, or cofibration, between their presheaf categories.
This guess is probably quite easy to prove.

It then explains why the usual forgetful functor from Gph to Set is an opfibration.

Moreover, in these cases - where the right adjoint we're interested in goes between presheaf categories, and comes from a functor going the other way between the underlying sites - I think it's easy to get pushouts to be strictly preserved.

That's my feeling based on the case Gph -> Set.   In this case we can first choose pushouts in Set, any way we want.

Then, to do a pushout out in Gph, we need to do a pushout of the sets of vertices and a pushout of the sets of edges - "in a presheaf category, pushouts are computed pointwise".

So, we just need to choose pushouts in Gph so that we use our chosen pushouts in Set when computing the pushout for the sets of vertices!

We can do that... it doesn't matter how we push out the sets of edges.

And then our functor Gph -> Set will strictly preserve pushouts.

I think it's also easy in this example to see how to make Gph -> Set into a "right adjoint left inverse".

So, my main point is that this example can probably be generalized to a bunch of examples involving presheaf categories.

\section{Preliminaries}\label{sec:preliminaries}

{\chris Mainly basics of fibrations and adjunctions, to fix terminology. Also Street stuff. Fill out as we go and organize better at the very end.
}

{\chris Strict choice of (co)limits}

In what follows, and in particular for our main \cref{thm:mainthm}, we often require that certain colimits must be \emph{strictly} preserved. Whereas such an uncommon condition sounds `evil' at first, we remark that it is the necessary such in order to match to the inherent `evilness' of Grothendieck fibrations. Moreover, in \cref{Streetfibs} we examine the non-strict context which then naturally matches to the notion of a Street fibration.

In more detail, assuming the axiom of choice we can regard any category with (co)limits as having \emph{chosen} ones, in the sense of choosing a specific adjoint (out of all isomorphic ones) to the diagonal. Some categories, like $\Set$, even have a canonical choice corresponding to well-known constructions of (co)limits of sets. The following two lemmas (due to Steve Lack) present two natural settings where functors between categories with chosen (co)limits strictly preserve them; evidently, such a thing is to be expected only when the limits in the categories have been both previously constructed from chosen limits in some fixed category.
\begin{lem}\label{lem:Lack1}
 Suppose $\ca{C}$ is a category with chosen (co)limits (of any class). Then for any two categories $\ca{A}$ and $\ca{B}$ and any functor $F\colon\ca{A}\to\ca{B}$ between them, the pre-composition functor
 \begin{displaymath}
  \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=.05in]
  F^*\colon[\ca{B},\ca{C}]\ar[r] & \;[\ca{A},\ca{C}] \\
  \;\;\;\;\ca{B}\xrightarrow{H}\ca{C}\ar[r,mapsto] & \ca{A}\xrightarrow{F}\ca{B}\xrightarrow{H}\ca{C}
  \end{tikzcd}
 \end{displaymath}
strictly preserves the chosen (co)limits.
\end{lem}
\begin{proof}
 This follows from the poinwise construction of colimits in functor categories.
\end{proof}

As a particular case, the following result gives rise to one of our main examples.
\begin{cor}
There is a canonical choice of (co)limits in $\Grph$ inherited from those in $\Set$ so that the domain and codomain functors $\Grph\to\Set$ strictly preserve all limits and colimits.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
 Consider the two functors $1,2\colon\one{=}\{\bullet\}\longrightarrow\{1\rightrightarrows2\}{=}\two$. Choosing the canonical (co)limits in $\Set$, by \cref{lem:Lack1} we obtain two functors
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{tikzcd}
 \Grph=[\two,\Set]\ar[r,shift left,"\mathrm{dom}"]\ar[r,shift right,"\mathrm{cod}"'] & \;[\one,\Set]=\Set
 \end{tikzcd}
\end{displaymath}
that strictly preserve them.
\end{proof}

The following case again follows a from construction of chosen limits in common ground; colimits adhere to a dual result.
\begin{lem}
Suppose $\ca{C}$ and $\ca{D}$ have chosen limits and $F\colon\ca{C}\to\ca{D}$ is an arbitrary functor. Then the comma category $F\downarrow\ca{D}$ can be equipped with chosen limits in such a way that the projections $\ca{C}\leftarrow F\downarrow\ca{D}\to\ca{D}$ strictly preserve limits.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
 This follows from the canonical construction of limits in comma categories, as found e.g.\ in~\cite[\S 2.16]{Handbook1}.
\end{proof}



{\chris Copied from Monoidal Groth, edit for sure}
We recall some basic facts and constructions from the theory of fibrations and indexed categories, as well as the equivalence between them via the Grothendieck construction.
A few indicative references for the general theory are \cite{Grayfibredandcofibred,FibredAdjunctions,Handbook2,Jacobs,Elephant1}.

Consider a functor $P \colon\A \to \X$. A morphism $\phi \colon a \to b$ in $\A $ over a morphism $f = P(\phi) \colon x \to y$ in $\X$ is called \define{cartesian} if and only if, for all $g \colon x' \to x$ in $\X$ and $\theta \colon a'\to a$ in $\A $ with $P \theta = f \circ g$, there exists a unique arrow $\psi \colon a'\to a$ such that $P \psi = g$ and $\theta = \phi \circ \psi$:
\begin{equation}
    \xymatrix @R=.1in @C=.6in
    {a'\ar [drr]^-{\theta}\ar @{-->}[dr]_-{\exists!\psi} 
    \ar @{.>}@/_/[dd] &&& \\
    & a\ar[r]_-{\phi} \ar @{.>}@/_/[dd] & 
    b \ar @{.>}@/_/[dd] & \textrm{in }\A \\
    x'\ar [drr]^-{f\circ g=P\theta}\ar[dr]_-g &&&\\
    & x\ar[r]_-{f=P\phi} & y & \textrm{in }\X}\label{eq:13}
\end{equation}
For $x \in \ob\X$, the \define{fibre of $P$ over $x$} written $\A_x$, is the subcategory of $\A$ which consists of objects $a$ such that $P(a) = x$ and morphisms $\phi$ with $P(\phi) = 1_x$, called \define{vertical} morphisms. The functor $P \colon \A \to \X$ is called a \define{fibration} if and only if, for all $f \colon x \to y$ in $\X$ and $b\in\A_Y$, there is a cartesian morphism $\phi$ with codomain $b$ above $f$; it is called a \define{cartesian lifting} of $b$ along $f$. The category $\X$ is then called the \define{base} of the fibration, and $\A $ its \define{total category}.

Dually, the functor $\U \colon \D \to \C$ is an \define{opfibration} if $\U^\mathrm{op}$ is a fibration, i.e.\ for every $a \in \D _x$ and $h \colon x \to y$ in $\C$, there is a cocartesian morphism with domain $a$ above $h$, the \define{cocartesian lifting} of $a$ along $h$ with the dual universal property:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:opfibration}
\xymatrix @R=.1in @C=.6in
{&& b'\ar @{.>}@/_/[dd] &&\\
a\ar[r]_-{\beta} \ar @{.>}@/_/[dd]
\ar[urr]^-{\gamma} & 
b \ar @{.>}@/_/[dd] \ar @{-->}[ur]_-{\exists! \delta}
&& \textrm{in }\D\\
&& y' &&\\
x\ar[r]_-{h=\U\beta} \ar[urr]^-{k\circ h=\U\gamma}
 & y \ar[ur]_-k && \textrm{in }\C}
\end{equation}
A \define{bifibration} is a functor which is both a fibration and opfibration.

If $P\colon \A \to\X$ is a fibration, assuming the axiom of choice we may select a cartesian arrow over each $f\colon x\to y$ in $\X$ and $b\in\A _y$, denoted by $\Cart(f,b)\colon f^*(b)\to b$. Such a choice of cartesian liftings is called a \define{cleavage} for $P$, which is then called a \define{cloven fibration}; any fibration is henceforth assumed to be cloven. Dually, if $\U$ is an opfibration, for any $a\in\D _x$ and $h \colon x \to y$ in $\C$ we can choose a cocartesian lifting of $a$ along $h$, $\Cocart(h,a)\colon a\longrightarrow h_!(a)$. 
Any arrow in the total category of an (op)fibration factorizes uniquely into
a vertical morphism followed by a (co)cartesian one: {\chris make small letters}
\begin{equation}\label{factor}
\xymatrix @C=.4in @R=.2in
{A\ar[rr]^\theta\ar @{-->}[d]_-{\psi} && B \ar @{.>}[dd] &\\
f^*B\ar[urr]_-{\;\Cart(f,B)} \ar @{.>}[d] &&& \textrm{in }\A  \\
X\ar[rr]_-{f} && Y & \textrm{in }\X,}\qquad
\xymatrix @C=.4in @R=.2in
{a \ar @{.>}[dd]\ar[rr]^\gamma \ar[drr]_-{\Cocart(g,a)} && b &\\
&& f_!C \ar @{-->}[u]_-{\delta} \ar @{.>}[d] & \textrm{in }\D  \\
a\ar[rr]_-{g} && y & \textrm{in }C.}
\end{equation}
The choice of (co)cartesian liftings in an (op)fibration induces a so-called \define{reindexing functor} between the fibre categories
\begin{equation}\label{reindexing}
    f^*\colon \A _y\to\A _x\quad\textrm{ and }\quad h_!\colon\D _x\to\C _y
\end{equation}
respectively, for each morphism $f\colon x\to y$ and $h\colon x\to y$ in the base category.
It can be verified by the (co)cartesian universal property that $1_{\A _x}\cong(1_x)^*$ 
and that for composable morphism in the base category, $g^*\circ f^*\cong(g\circ f)^* $, as well as $(1_x)_!\cong1_{\A_x}$ and $(k\circ h)_!\cong k_!\circ h_!$. If these isomorphisms are equalities, we have the notion of a \define{split} (op)fibration.

{\chris fibrations and limits, as briefly as possible?}
The following relates the existence of (co)limits in the total category of an (op)fibration to their existence in the fibres; for more details, see \cite{hermidaphd}.

\begin{lem}\label{lem:fibrewiselimits}
Suppose $\ca{J}$ is a small category and $\P\colon\X\to\A$ is an (op)fibration. If $\A$ has $\ca{J}$-(co)limits,
the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item all fibres have $\ca{J}$-(co)limits, and the reindexing functors preserve them;
 \item $\X$ has $\ca{J}$-(co)limits, and $\P$ strictly preserves them.\label{it:2}
\end{enumerate}
\end{lem}
This formulation relates fibrations with limits and opfibrations with colimits.
In fact, condition \ref{it:2} defines when an arbitrary (op)fibration (not necessarily having a $\ca{J}$-(co)complete base) has \emph{(op)fibred $\ca{J}$-(co)limits}.

{\chris some comments about fibrations strictly preserving limits, based on the local aspect of Fib as a 2-Fib}
\cite{Fib2Fib}

{\chris Street fibrations stuff}

...

{\chris adjunctions stuff}

We will use the acronym \emph{lari}, originally introduced in~\cite{Grayfibredandcofibred}, for the notion of a `left adjoint, right inverse' functor. Explicitly, if $\U\colon\ca{D}\to\ca{C}$ has a lari $\L$, then $\L\dashv \U$ and $\eta\colon1_\ca{C}=\U\L$. Equivalently, in this case we can say that $\U$ is a \emph{rali}, namely it is a right adjoint, left inverse of some $\L$ --- still the unit of the adjunction is the identity, with $\U$ now being a left inverse. Analogously, if a functor has a \emph{rari} or equivalently is a \emph{lali}, then the counit of the adjunction is the identity.

Both these notions are special cases of the well-known notions of \emph{(co)reflections}, i.e. ...
{\chris Position here the well-known equivalences clauses for coreflections, also their strict versions for laris.}
\begin{prop}\label{prop:coreflection}
 The following are equivalent for an adjunction $\L\dashv\U\colon\D\to\C$:
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\L$ is strictly fully faithful (resp. fully faithful);
  \item the unit $\eta\colon1_\C\Rightarrow \U\L$ is the identity (resp. isomorphism).
 \end{enumerate}
Under these conditions, $\U\epsilon$ and $\epsilon_\L$ are identities (resp. isomorphisms).
\end{prop}


\section{Grothendieck fibrations and ralis}
\label{sec:groth-fibs-ralis}

In this section, we investigate conditions under which opfibrations and adjunctions with identity unit relate to one another. The main result, \cref{thm:mainthm}, exhibits their bijective correspondence under the intersection of the respective conditions.

Initially we establish when an opfibration has a left adjoint; the following result is the dual of \cite[Prop. 4.4]{Grayfibredandcofibred}.

%changed from has a lari to is a rali to make descriptions of categories easier later - hopefully! Otherwise change back.
\begin{prop} \label{prop:opfibtolari}
  Let $\U \from \D \to \C$ be an opfibration. Then
  $\U$ is a rali if (and only if) its fibers have
  initial objects which are preserved by the
  reindexing functors.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
Denote by $\bot_a$ the initial object in each fiber $\D_x$ above an object $a\in\C$ in the base category. Define a left adjoint $\L$
of $\U$ as follows:
\begin{displaymath}
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=.05in,cells={anchor=east}]
  \L\colon\A\ar[rr] && \X\;\; &\\
  a\ar[rr,mapsto]\ar[dd,"f"'] && \bot_a\ar[dd,dashed,"\L f"']\ar[ddr,"{\Cocart(f,\bot_a)}"] & \\
\hole \\
b\ar[rr,mapsto] && \bot_b & f_!(\bot_a)\ar[l,"\sim"']
\end{tikzcd}
\end{displaymath}
where the bottom isomorphism is the unique one
induced by the fact that each $f_!$ preserves
initial objects between the respective
fibers.
% looks like the first time we define a
% morphism in the total category via its
% unique factorization! alright.
This assignment is strictly functorial due to the
universal properties of cocartesian
liftings. Notice that by definition,
$\L a =\bot_a$ is in the fibre $\X_a$, which means
$\U\L a =a$ for any object $a\in\A$.

To show this determines a left adjoint of $\U$, it
suffices to establish a natural bijection
$\X(\L a,x)\cong\A(a,\U x)$ for any $a\in\A$,
$x\in\X$. Indeed, each morphism in he total
category $k\colon \L a\to x$ above $f=\U k$,
factorizes uniquely \cref{factor} as
\begin{displaymath}
\xymatrix @C=.5in @R=.3in
{\bot_a \ar @{.>}[dd]\ar[rr]^k \ar[drr]_-{\Cocart(f,\bot_a)} && x &\\
&& f_!(\bot_a) \ar @{-->}[u]_-s \ar @{.>}[d] & \textrm{in }\X \\
a\ar[rr]_-{f} && \U x & \textrm{in }\A}
\end{displaymath}
but since $f_!(\bot_a)\cong\bot_{\U x}$ is the initial object in the fibre above $\U x$, the morphism $s$ is in fact unique. As a result, every $k$ uniquely corresponds to some $f$ in that way, and this isomorphism is natural.

Finally, the right adjoint $\U$ is indeed a left
inverse of $\L$, namely the unit of the adjunction
$\eta\colon 1_\A \to \U\L$ is the identity natural
transformation: $\U\L a=a$ and moreover $\X (\L a,\L a)\cong\A(a,\U\L a)$ ensures that the identity $\bot_a$ corresponds to the identity on $a$. %which should be clear from the above described bijection!
\end{proof}

The `only if' direction of the statement is not needed for our purposes. Notice that in particular, since $\U$ is a right adjoint, it ends up preserving all limits that exist in $\X$; this makes the above condition for its existence look slightly unintuitive. 

The dual result states that a fibration is a lali, or equivalently has a rari namely the counit of the adjunction is the identity, if and only if the fibers have terminal objects that are preserved by the reindexing functors. Due to \cref{lem:fibrewiselimits}, we can express both these results as follows.

\begin{cor}
An (op)fibration is a (right) left adjoint left inverse if the base category has and the functor strictly preserves the (initial) terminal object.
\end{cor}

Next, we examine when a right adjoint left inverse has an opfibration structure. The relevant colimits in this case are pushouts, and the following result provides sufficient conditions in terms of those. Recall the discussion regarding strict preservation of colimits in \cref{sec:preliminaries}.

\begin{prop}\label{prop:laritoopfib}
Suppose that $\U\colon\X\to\A$ is a rali, with left adjoint right inverse $\L$. Then $\U$ is an opfibration if $\X$ and $\A$ have chosen pushouts such that $\U$ strictly preserves them.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
First of all, suppose that the rali $\U\colon\X\to\A$ preserves pushouts, which are chosen such that pushouts  of a morphism along an identity is the morphism itself. We will show it has the structure of a cloven Grothendieck opfibration. Indeed, take a morphism $f\colon a\to b$ in $\A$ and an object $x\in\X$ above $a$, as in
\begin{displaymath}
\xymatrix @C=.5in @R=.3in
{x \ar @{.>}[d]_-{\U} &&& \textrm{in }\X \\
a\ar[rr]_-{f} && b & \textrm{in }\A .}
\end{displaymath}
Define the cocartesian lifting of $x$ along $f$ to be the horizontal dashed arrow to the (chosen) pushout of the following diagram in $\X$ 
\begin{displaymath}
 \begin{tikzcd}
   \L\U x\ar[r,"\L f"]\ar[d,"\varepsilon_a"'] & \L b\ar[d,dashed] \\
   x\ar[r,dashed] & x+_{\L\U x} \L b
 \end{tikzcd}
\end{displaymath}
where $\varepsilon\colon \L\U\Rightarrow1_\X$ is the counit
of the adjunction $\L\dashv \U$. To verify this is a cocartesian lifting, first of all it must be mapped to
$f$ via $\U$: if we apply $\U$ to the above
square, using the facts that
$\U\varepsilon_x=1_{a}$, $\U\L f=f$ (by \cref{prop:coreflection}) and
$$\U (x+_{\L\U x}\L b)=\U x+_{\U\L\U x}\U\L b =
a+_{a} b $$ since $\U$ strictly preserves pushouts, the
resulting colimit diagram 
\begin{displaymath}
 \begin{tikzcd}
  a\ar[r,"f"]\ar[d,"1_a"'] & b\ar[d,dashed] \\
a\ar[r,dashed] & a+_{a}b=b
 \end{tikzcd}
\end{displaymath}
is \emph{the} pushout of $f$ along the identity, namely $f$ due to our choice. Moreover, the universal property \cref{eq:opfibration} of the proposed cocartesian lifting follows from universality of pushouts thus the one direction of the proof is complete.
\end{proof}
%Christina: tried to see whether the converse is true, didn't go far. Remember that from previous prop we got it preserves initial for sure!

Combining \cref{prop:opfibtolari,prop:laritoopfib}, we obtain the following result that establishes certain conditions under which a Grothendieck opfibration structure on a functor corresponds to a rali structure and vice versa. %Christina: no more finite colimits: Steve said that for the strict case, this is more subtle than the ordinary case. Pretty sure that we don't wanna go into details there?
%Understand whether other such conditions could exist? More philosophically.

\begin{thm}\label{thm:mainthm}
Suppose that $\X$ and $\A$ have chosen pushouts and initial objects, and a functor $\U\colon\X\to\A$ strictly preserves them. Then $\U$ is a right adjoint left inverse if and only if $\U$ is an opfibration.
\end{thm}

\section{Street fibrations and coreflections}\label{Streetfibs}

In this section, we trod the same path as in
Section \ref{sec:groth-fibs-ralis} yet shed all
strictness of the preservation of colimits.  One
effect of this is that we work with Street
opfibrations instead of Grothendeick
opfibrations.

{\daniel Define Street opfibrations here or in prelimiaries?}

Generalising \cref{prop:opfibtolari}, we obtain
the following. 

\begin{prop}
  \label{thm:street-opfib-to-corefl}
  Let $ \U \from \X \to \A $ be a Street
  opfibration. Then $ \U $ is a coreflector if its
  fibers have initial objects which are preserved
  by the reindexing functors.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  We define $ \L $ exactly as in Proposition
  \ref{prop:opfibtolari}. 

  The unit of the adjunction $ \L \dashv \U $ is the
  identity $ a\to \U\L a = \U\bot_a = a $.  The
  counit is the initial map $ \bot_{\U x} = \L\U x \to
  x $.  The triangle identities are satisfied as
  well. The first is the composite
  \[
    \L a
    \xto{\L\eta_a}        \L\U\L a
    \xto{\epsilon_{\L a}} \L a
  \]
  which is given by $ \bot_a \to \bot_a \to \bot_a
  $.  The second is the composite
  \[
    \U x
    \xto{\eta_{\U x}} \U\L\U x
    \xto{\U\eta_x}    \U x
  \]
  which is given by $ \U x \to \U x \to \U x $.

  Because the unit of the adjunction is an
  isomorphism, $ \L $ is full and faithful
  \cite[{Prop.~1.3}]{gabrielzisman} making $ \U $ a
  coreflector.
\end{proof}

Generalising \cref{prop:laritoopfib}, we obtain the following result.

\begin{prop}
  \label{thm:corefl-to-street-obfib}
  Suppose that $ \U \from \X \to \A $ is a
  coreflector. Then $ \U $ is a Street obfibration
  if $ \X $ has pushouts and $ \U $ preserves them.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
  Fix an arrow $ f \from a \to b $ in $ \A $
  and an object $ x $ in the fibre of $ a $. We
  claim that $ \hat{f} $, defined as the pushout
  of $ \L f $
  along the counit $ \epsilon_x $
  \[
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node (ul) at (0,2) {$ \L \U x $};
      \node (ll) at (0,0) {$ x $};
      \node (ur) at (2,2) {$ \L b $};
      \node (lr) at (2,0) {$ x +_{\L\U x} \L b$};
      \draw [->] (ul) to node [left] {$ \epsilon $} (ll);
      \draw [->] (ul) to node [above] {$ \L f $} (ur);
      \draw [->] (ll) to node [above] {$ \hat{f} $} (lr);
      \draw [->] (ur) to (lr);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \]
  is the cocartesian lift. There is a string of
  isomorphisms
  \[
    \U ( x +_{\L\U x} \L b ) \cong
    \U x +_{\U\L\U x} \L b \cong
    \U x +_{\U x} b \cong
    b
  \]
  whose composite we call $ h $.  Then
  \[
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node (a) at (0,0) {$ a $};
      \node (b) at (2,0) {$ b $};
      \node (c) at (2,2) {$ \U ( x+_{\L\U x} \L b ) $};
      \path[->,font=\scriptsize]
      (a) edge node[below]{$ f $} (b)
      (a) edge node[above]{$ \U\hat{f} $} (c)
      (c) edge node[right]{$ h $} (b);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \]
  commutes, and so $ \hat{f} $ is an appropriate
  lift. It remains to show that $ \hat{f} $ is
  cocartesian.

  Consider a $ \X $-arrow $ g \from x \to y $
  with a $ \A $-arrow
  $ \theta \from \U( x +_{\L\U x} \L b ) \to \U y $ so
  that $ \theta \U \hat{f} = \U g $.  Can we
  uniquely lift $ \theta $? Set up the diagram
  \[
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node (ul) at (0,2) {$ \L\U x $};
      \node (ll) at (0,0) {$ x $};
      \node (ur) at (2,2) {$ \L b $};
      \node (lr) at (2,0) {$ x +_{\L\U x} \L b$};
      \node (comp) at (4,-2) {y};
      \draw [->] (ul) to node [left] {$ \epsilon_x $} (ll);
      \draw [->] (ul) to node [above] {$ \L f $} (ur);
      \draw [->] (ll) to node [above] {$ \hat{f} $} (lr);
      \draw [->] (ur) to (lr);
      \draw [->] (ll) to [bend right=20] node [above] {$ g $} (comp);
      \draw [->] (ur) to [bend left=20] node [above] {$ g' $} (comp);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \] 
  where $ g' \bydef \epsilon_y \L\theta \L h^{-1} $.
  To show the outer square commutes, it suffices
  to show that $ g' \L f $ and $ g \epsilon_x $
  have the same image under the adjunction homset
  correspondence.  We have
  \[
    g' \circ \L f =
    \epsilon_y \circ \L\theta \circ \L h \circ \L f
    \mapsto
    \U\epsilon_y \circ \U\L\theta \circ \U\L h
      \circ \U\L f \circ\eta_{ux}
    = \theta \circ h \circ f   
    = \theta \circ \U \circ \hat{f} 
    = \U g
  \]
  and 
  \[
    g \epsilon_x
    \mapsto
    \U g \circ \eta_{\U x}
    = \U g
  \]
\end{proof}

We now intersect the hypothesis of Propositions
\ref{thm:street-opfib-to-corefl} and
\ref{thm:corefl-to-street-obfib} to provide the
main result of this section.

{\daniel The statement depends on Lemma
  \ref{lem:fibrewiselimits} holding for Street
  obfibrations too.}

\begin{thm}
  \label{thm:main-theorem-street-version}
  Suppose that $ \A $ and $ \X $ have chosen
  initial objects and pushouts. Then $ \U $ is a
  coreflector if and only if $ \U $ is a Street
  opfibration.  
\end{thm}

\section{Miscellaneous Theorems}

% \begin{thm}[Freyd's general adjoint functor theorem]
% \label{thm:GAFT}
% 	A functor $ F \from X \to Y $ is a right adjoint if  $ x $ is complete, locally small, and $ F $ satisfies the \emph{solution set condition}. The latter says, for any $ Y $-object $ y $, there exists a small set $ I $ indexing a collection of $ X $-objects $ {x_i}_I $ and $ Y $-arrows $ {f_i \from y \to F ( x_i ) } $ such that every $ F $-valued $ Y $-arrow $ y \to R x $ factors as $ Fg . f_k $ for $ k \in I $ and $ g \from x_k \to x $.
% \end{thm}

% \begin{proof}
% 	The proof is V.6.2 in CWM.  Define the left adjoint $ G \from Y \to X $ by $ G (y) \coloneqq x $ where $ y \to F x $ is initial in the comma category $ y \downarrow F $.  
% \end{proof}

% \begin{thm}[Gabriel-Zisman]
% \label{thm:GabZis}
% 	An adjunction $ \L \dashv R \from \ca{C} \leftrightarrow \ca{D} $. TFAE:
% 	\begin{enumerate}
% 		\item $ \L $ is full and faithful;
% 		\item the unit is an isomorphism;
% 		\item the induced comonad on $ \ca{D} $ is idempotent, $ \L $ is conservative, and $ R $ is essentially surjective.
% 	\end{enumerate}
% \end{thm}

{\daniel The following theorems were attempts at
  getting at an inverse of the RALI gives a
  St. opfibration.  But now with Theorem
  \ref{thm:street-opfib-to-corefl}, we probably
  don't need them.  Should we throw them away or
  keep them as nifty things?} {\chris Good question! If we are to keep, we should probably do so before our results and say how those would be reasonable things to start with, but instead we had to roam elsewhere for that and that reason!}

\begin{thm}
	Let $ \ca{D}$ be locally small and complete. Also let $ R \from \ca{D} \to \ca{C} $ be a continuous, surjective-on-objects Grothendiek opfibration.  Then $ R $ is a right adjoint.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	We use \ref{thm:GAFT}.  Suffice to show the solution set condition holds.  Fix a $ C $-objects $ c $.  Then the indexing set is $ \ast $, the collection of $ D $-objects consists of a single object $ x_c $ over $ c $ (which exists by surjective-on-objects assumption), and the collection of $ \ca{C} $-arrows consists of the identity.  Any map $ f \from c \to Rd $ has a cocartesian lifting $ \hat{f} \from x_c \to x_{Rd} $ and $ f = R \hat{f} . 1_c $.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
	Let $ \ca{D}$ be locally small and complete. Also let $ R \from \ca{D} \to \ca{C} $ be a continuous, surjective-on-objects, conservative Street opfibration.  Then $ R $ is a right adjoint.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	We use \ref{thm:GAFT}.  Suffice to show the solution set condition holds.  Fix a $ C $-objects $ c $.  Then the indexing set is $ \ast $, the collection of $ D $-objects consists of a single object $ x_c $ over $ c $ (which exists by surjective-on-objects assumption), and the collection of $ \ca{C} $-arrows consists of the identity.  For any map $ f \from c \to Rd $, there exists an essential cocartesian lifting $ \hat{f} \from x_c \to d' $ together with a $ \ca{C} $-isomorphism $ h \from Rd' \to Rd $ such that $ f = h . R \hat{f} $. But $ f = h . R \hat{f} = R \hat{h} . R \hat{f} . 1_c = R (\hat{h} . \hat{f}) . 1_c $ where $ h = R \hat{h} $ because $ R $ is conservative.
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}
	Let $ \ca{D}$ be locally small and complete. Also let $ R \from \ca{D} \to \ca{C} $ be a continuous, essentially surjective, conservative Street opfibration.  Then $ R $ is a right adjoint.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
	We use \ref{thm:GAFT}.  Suffice to show the solution set condition holds.  Fix a $ C $-object $ c $.  Then the indexing set is $ \ast $, the collection of $ D $-objects consists of a single object $ d' $ where $ \theta \from c \cong Rd' $ (which exists by essential surjectivity), and the collection of $ \ca{C} $-arrows is $ { \theta } $.  For any $ \ca{C} $-arrow $ f \from c \to Rd $, we have (by Street opfibrationness) $ f . \theta^{-1} \from Rd' \to c \to Rd $, a cocartesian essential lifting $ \hat{ f . \theta^{-1} } \from d' \to d'' $ in $ \ca{D} $, and an isomorphism $ h \from d \to d'' $ (by conservatism) such that $ f . \theta^{-1} = Rh . R \hat{ f . \theta^{-1} } $.  This implies, as required by GAFT, that $ f = R (h\hat{ f . \theta }) . \theta $.
\end{proof}

Thoughts about these assumptions. Here are the desired examples I can think of now: $ \ca{Set} $ together with $ \ca{Graph} $ or $ \ca{Top} $. The enriched over sets and completeness are both there. So is essential surjectivity. And reflection of isomorphisms.  The continuity is definitely needed, since it's necessary if $ R $ is a right adjoint. 

Go back to the right adjoint we had in the ``converse'' to the above theorem.  That is, we have a coreflection $ \L \dashv R \from \ca{C} \leftrightarrow \ca{D} $ where $ \L $ is left exact.  Of course this gives the continuity of $ R $. Essential surjectivity follows from Gabriel-Zisman. Is it a Street opfibration? $ \L $ is conservative, but is $ R $?

\begin{ex}
  No, $ R $ is not in general conservative.
  Consider the underlying node functor
  $ \Grph \to \Set $.  All $ \Grph $-endomorphisms
  on
  \[
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \node (a) at (0,0) {$ \bullet $};
      \node (b) at (2,0) {$ \bullet $};
      \draw [->] (a.30) to (b.150);
      \draw [->] (a.-30) to (b.-150);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \]
  are sent to the identity on $ 2 $.
\end{ex}

\section{Categories of fibrations and adjunctions}

The key players here are subcategories of $\OpFib$ of those opfibrations that are fibred cocomplete, and of something like
$\Rali$ of ralis that strictly preserve all colimits.

{\chris Also, not sure if separate section for that, but we should try and include as many reasonable examples as possible. The quality rather
than the quantity is important I think! Grph Set the first such.}
{\chris Daniel mentioned we may want to do these things inside an arbitrary 2-category, at least for STreet fibration which is more natural and less evil? That would certainly be cool!}

We are closing in on a pair of theorems.

\begin{thm}
	Fix an adjunction 
	\[
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\node (C) at (0,0) {$ C $}	;
		\node (D) at (2,0) {$ D $}	;
		\draw [->] (C.30) to node {$ L $} (D.150);
		\draw [->] (D.210) to node [swap] {$ R $} (C.-30);
	\end{tikzpicture}
	\]
	$ R $ is a Street opfibration if and only if the adjunction in \nice.	
\end{thm}

\begin{theorem}
	Given a Street opfibration $ R $, it has a left adjoint when it is \nice.
\end{theorem}
